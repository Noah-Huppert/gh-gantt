**Project Status:** Development paused for the foreseeable future  

All stakeholders (me included) no longer needed a Gantt chart for ZenHub.  

Progress was made to retrieve issue details from ZenHub and a rudimentary gantt 
could be created. However no critical path finding logic was implemented.  

If you are interested in continuing development in a fork and would like to ask
questions about the existing code base feel free to open an issue.

# Overview
GH Gantt displays GitHub issues in gantt chart form. ZenHub is used to augment 
GitHub issues with additional information.  

See the [wiki](https://github.com/Noah-Huppert/gh-gantt/wiki) for design information.
